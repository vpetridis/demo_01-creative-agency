# Creative Agency

This is a <strong>demo</strong> single page site built with html & css. It is a design challenge from this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/creative-agency-singlepage-site-Pq6V3I2RM"> Frontend-Mentor project</a> . Check out my <a href="https://vpetridis.github.io/demo_01-creative-agency/">demo</a>!

# Practice makes better

Goals:
- Make it as DRY and as well structured as possible.
- Investigate the mockup and built the page without any guidelines. I didn't have any access to the README.md file.
- Create meaningful CSS class names.
- Use mostly Flexbox and Grid.
= Fully responsive for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile view.

<em>P.S. Since there is not much interactivity on the site, I worked mostly on the CSS. No JS involved.</em>
