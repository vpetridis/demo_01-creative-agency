# Creative Agency

This is a <strong>demo</strong> single page site. It is a design challenge from this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/creative-agency-singlepage-site-Pq6V3I2RM"> frontend-mentor </a> project.

# Practice makes better

- Make it as DRY and as well structured as possible.
- Investigate the mockup and built the page without any guidelines.
- Create meaningful CSS class names.
- Use mostly Flexbox and Grid

<em>P.S. Since there is not much interactivity on the site, I worked mostly on the CSS.</em>
