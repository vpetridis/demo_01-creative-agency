# Creative Agency

This is a <strong>demo</strong> single page site. It is a design challenge from this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/creative-agency-singlepage-site-Pq6V3I2RM"> frontend-mentor </a> project.

# Practice makes better

I tried to be as clean and well structured with my code as possible. 
Since there is not much interactivity on the site, I worked extensively on my CSS classes.
